#Vector drawing 

A simple vector graphics drawing program using Java Swing

## Executing and Running the vector Drawing Program:
Give execution permission to compile_run.sh if not present.
For the ease of execution I have created a script called compile_run.sh 
This script should compile all java class and run the main File as well(UI will pop up here).
Please make sure that the script has execution permissions  which can be given 
using Chmod 777 <script_name>.


## Executing and running JUNIT Tests :
Similarly for the execution of Test cases, I have created another Shell script called
run_Tests.sh
This script will compile the necessary test case java files and also run the test cases
as well.
If any test cases fail, It will be displayed and if any fail that is also displayed.

## Deliverables executed
This practical has been implemented using Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
All Basic requirements have been satisfied and implemented here.
Advanced feature of saving and reloading vector drawintg was attempted but was unsuccessful.
